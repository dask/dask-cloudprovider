   âš  This library is in early alpha. Development is currently iterating on
   master. Will switch to regular GitHub flow once things stabalize.
   Use at own risk.


Native Cloud integration for Dask. This library intends to allow people to
create dask clusters on a given cloud provider with no set up other than having
credentials.
