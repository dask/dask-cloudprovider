Dask Cloud Provider
===================

*Native Cloud integration for Dask.*

This library creates Dask clusters on a given cloud provider
with no set up other than having credentials.
Currently, it only supports AWS.

Installation
------------

Pip
^^^

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install dask-cloudprovider
   
Conda
^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

   $ conda install -c conda-forge dask-cloudprovider
   
-----

Below are the different modules for creating clusters on various cloud
providers.

AWS
---

In order to create clusters on AWS you need to set your access key, secret key
and region. The simplest way is to use the aws command line tool.

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install awscli
   $ aws configure

Fargate/ECS
^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``FargateCluster`` will create a new Fargate ECS cluster by default along
with all the IAM roles, security groups, and so on that it needs to function.

.. code-block:: python

   from dask_cloudprovider import FargateCluster
   cluster = FargateCluster()

..

   âš  All AWS resources created by ``FargateCluster`` should be removed on
   garbage collection. If the process is killed harshly this will not happen.

You can also create Dask clusters using EC2 based ECS clusters using
``ECSCluster``.

Creating the ECS cluster is out of scope for this library but you can pass in
the ARN of an existing one like this:

.. code-block:: python

   from dask_cloudprovider import ECSCluster
   cluster = ECSCluster(cluster_arn="arn:aws:ecs:<region>:<acctid>:cluster/<clustername>")

All the other required resources such as roles, task definitions, tasks, etc
will be created automatically like in ``FargateCluster``.

GPU Support
~~~~~~~~~~~

There is also support in ``ECSCLuster`` for GPU aware Dask clusters. To do
this you need to create an ECS cluster with GPU capable instances (from the
``p3`` or ``p3dn`` families) and specify the number of GPUs each worker task
should have.

.. code-block:: python

   from dask_cloudprovider import ECSCluster
   cluster = ECSCluster(
       cluster_arn="arn:aws:ecs:<region>:<acctid>:cluster/<gpuclustername>",
       worker_gpu=1)
